# Jumpstart E-commerce - AI-Powered Fashion Retailer

This is an Aceadora Tech's (Fictional company and a School Capstone Project) Jumpstart E-commerce. This is a simulated online fashion retailer that will showcase AI-powered product description generation in product description, where the user will be the admin managing the product descriptions. This project showcases how AI can create compelling, authentic product listings for a wide range of items.

Note: This is a school project for educational purposes only and not a real commercial product.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of AI in e-commerce through automated product description generation. It is a school project and not intended to function as a real commercial site. The goal is to showcase the capabilities of AI in creating compelling product listings. The project is built using React.js, **Python FastAPI**, and **Google Gemini API** for real AI-powered content generation. Unlike Amazon or other e-commerce websites, this may not look legitimate or have the same functionality. I included a homepage, about us, and contact us.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real AI-Generated Product Descriptions**: Intelligent product descriptions using Google Gemini AI
- **Smart Fallback System**: Automatic template generation when API quota is exceeded
- **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS
- **Product Catalog**: Fashion items with detailed features and specifications
- **Interactive UI**: Clean navigation between Home and Products pages
- **Dual Generation System**: AI-first with template backup for reliability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js 18+** - Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - Fast development build tool
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### Backend
- **Python 3.8+** - Programming language for AI integration
- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **Google Gemini AI (gemini-1.5-flash)** - AI model for content generation
- **Uvicorn** - ASGI server for Python web applications

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher) - for the frontend
- Python 3.8+ - for the AI backend
- npm or yarn package manager
- Google Gemini API key (optional, for real AI generation)

### AI Setup (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Getting a free Gemini API key**:
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a free account
   - Generate your API key (50 requests/day free tier)

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your API key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Without API key**: The app works with mock product description when the API ran out

## ü§ñ AI Integration

### Current Implementation
- **Primary**: Real Google Gemini AI generation (50 free requests/day)
- **Fallback**: Smart template system when quota exceeded
- **Short & Practical**: Inspired by Amazon/Lazada-style descriptions
- Simulated API calls with loading states

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with OpenAI GPT API
- Real-time description generation
- Sentiment analysis for product reviews
- Personalized product recommendations

## üéØ Use Cases

This application demonstrates AI implementation in several key areas:
- **Automated Content Creation**: AI-generated product descriptions
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Quick, compelling product information
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced manual content creation time
- **Scalability**: Consistent description quality across large product catalogs



## üé® Design Principles

- **Clean & Modern**: Minimalist design focusing on product presentation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML and proper ARIA labels
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and smooth interactions

## üìù Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a school project and my sole work only, demonstrating AI implementation in e-commerce. The focus is on showcasing how I can integrate AI to enhance product descriptions and improve customer experience in online retail.
